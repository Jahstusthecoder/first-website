<br> <h2>That pink stuff is not food. It could be ammonia. A lifelong non-smoker who was the victim of a massive accidental exposure to anhydrous ammonia gas was followed up for 10 years. In the acute phase the patient presented with severe tracheobronchitis and respiratory failure, caused by very severe burns of the respiratory mucosa. After some improvement he was left with severe and fixed airways obstruction. Isotope studies of mucociliary clearance, computed tomography, and bronchography showed mild bronchiectasis. It is concluded that acute exposure to high concentrations of ammonia may lead to acute respiratory injury but also to long term impairment of respiratory function.

Mcdonald's is undoubtedly the most well-known fast-food chain worldwide. Starting out as a barbeque restaurant set up by brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald in California in 1940, the foodservice company soon evolved into a humble production-line style burger stand. Since then, Mcdonald's has grown into a global giant with increasing numbers of stores year-on-year - in 2015, Mcdonalds had 36,525 restaurants worldwide. Mcdonald's was by far the most valuable fast food brand in 2015. With a brand value of more than 81 billion U.S. dollars, the company outpaced its closest competitor, Starbucks, by approximately 50 billion. That year, Mcdonald's was also the ninth largest brand overall worldwide.

In 2014, Mcdonald's generated revenues of more than 25 billion U.S. dollars, the largest proportion of which came from the U.S.. Despite the company's revenue success, Mcdonald's received a lower than average American Customer Satisfaction Index score for several consecutive years leading up to 2015. As well as this, Mcdonald's burgers were rated the lowest for their taste out of 21 of Amercan's most popular burger chains.

Competition is something Mcdonald's will have to get used to, especially in the huge and ever-growing fast food industry in the United States. In 2013, the revenue of the U.S. fast food industry reached 191 billion U.S. dollars and was forecasted to exceed 210 billion by 2018.
