  <h3>Mcdonalds keep saying there beef is real,but they dont know the real truth about it.here is a prargraph about thier real food.
    <h2>At Mcdonalds, were making changes based on what were hearing from all of you. that's why we work hard to make tasty food with a "less is more" philosophy. But what does that mean? It means we use 100% real beef patties seasoned with just a pinch of salt and pepper. It means our Egg McMuffin is made with a freshly-cracked egg. And, in the U.S., our fish filets are made from sustainably-sourced Alaskan Pollock. It means we use real buttermilk in our Buttermilk Crispy Chicken and our Chicken McNuggets are made with white meat chicken. To put it frankly, it means - The Simpler The Better.
<h3> When they said they thier meat 100% real beef patties, do you thing thats true? Also when they make thier egg Mcmuffin is made with freshly cracked eggs. why does thier eggs come out dry nasty? The ingredients to the burgers have Enriched flour(bleached Wheat flour,malted barley flour) that sounds disqusting. Bleached flour is flour chemicaly truned white.The other ingredients are Niacin, reduced iron Thiamin  mononitriate, Riboflavin, folic acid, water, high Fructose Cron syrup and/or sugar, yeast, Soybean oil, Contains 2%or less: Salt, Wheat Gluten, calcium slufate, Calcium carbonate,and ammonium sufate
  Where the ground beef at. I found it . That say a it only has 15% meat inside it, don't you want 100% meat?
